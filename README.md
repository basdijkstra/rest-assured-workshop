REST Assured workshop
==================
For those of you looking to gain some experience working with [REST Assured](http://rest-assured.io/), here are all the materials from a workshop I've created and delivered multiple times to good reviews. Feel free to use, share and adapt these materials as you see fit.

What do I need?
---
A Java JDK (version 17 or newer), Maven and an IDE of your choice. That's it.

What API is used for the exercises?
---
All API calls that are used in the examples and exercises have been mocked using [WireMock](http://wiremock.org/). WireMock is included in this project as a dependency, so there's no need for additional setup.

Running the mock server
---
The mock server used to respond to the API calls you're making in the exercises is started and stopped automatically using the `@WireMockTest` annotation.


Running the tests using Maven
---

```bash
mvn clean test
```

Slides
---
The .pptx/.pdf/.odp file in the root folder contains all slides from the workshop. Again, feel free to use, share and adapt them to fit your own requirements.

Comments? Saying thanks?
---
Feel free to file an issue here, or email me at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I'd rather have you deliver the workshop instead...
---
Sure, I'd love to. Again, email me and I'll be happy to discuss options. In house or at your conference, I'm sure we can work something out.
